- Frontend running on http://localhost:4000
- SuperAdmin auth already configured
- E2E_TEST_MODE enabled

## 🔧 How to Extend This Test

To add new test coverage:

1. **Add to checklist above** - Mark what you want to test
2. **Add helper function** - Create API helper in test file
3. **Add test step** - Insert new step in workflow
4. **Add verification** - Validate data via API and/or UI
5. **Update this checklist** - Check off the item

Example:
```typescript
// Add helper function
async function testAIEmailGeneration(request, opportunityId) {
  const res = await request.post(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/ai/generate-email`, {
    data: {
      tenant_id: E2E_TENANT_ID,
      opportunity_id: opportunityId,
      email_type: 'follow_up',
    },
  });
  return res.json();
}

// Add to workflow
console.log('\n🤖 STEP X: Testing AI email generation...');
const aiEmail = await testAIEmailGeneration(request, opportunityId);
expect(aiEmail.data?.content).toBeTruthy();
console.log('✅ AI email generated successfully');
```
