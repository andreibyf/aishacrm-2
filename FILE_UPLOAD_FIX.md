# File Upload Fix for Tenant Logos

## Problem
When uploading a logo for a test tenant, it didn't retain the uploaded file. This was because:
1. **`UploadFile` function was calling Base44 SDK** - which is not available in local dev mode
2. **No local file storage implemented** - backend storage route was a stub returning "not implemented"

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

**1. Installed multer for file uploads**
```bash
cd backend && npm install multer
```

**2. Updated `backend/routes/storage.js`**
- Added multer configuration for file uploads
- Files are stored in `public/assets/uploads/`
- Supports images only: jpeg, jpg, png, gif, webp, svg
- Max file size: 5MB
- Auto-generates unique filenames: `originalname-timestamp-random.ext`
- Returns URL as `/assets/uploads/filename.ext`

### Frontend Changes

**3. Updated `src/api/integrations.js`**
- Replaced Base44 SDK `UploadFile` with custom implementation
- Sends multipart form data to `${backendUrl}/api/storage/upload`
- Works in both local dev and production
- Returns `{ file_url, filename, success }`

**4. Created upload directory**
- `public/assets/uploads/` for storing uploaded files
- Vite will serve these files from the public directory
- Added `.gitkeep` to preserve directory structure

## How It Works Now

### Upload Flow
1. User selects logo file in Tenant Setup/Management dialog
2. `TenantSetup.jsx` or `TenantManagement.jsx` calls `handleLogoUpload()`
3. Calls `UploadFile({ file })` from `src/api/integrations.js`
4. Sends POST request to `http://localhost:3001/api/storage/upload` with FormData
5. Backend saves file to `public/assets/uploads/unique-filename.ext`
6. Returns `{ file_url: "/assets/uploads/unique-filename.ext" }`
7. Frontend updates `formData.logo_url` with the returned URL
8. User saves tenant → `logo_url` is stored in database
9. Image displays via `<img src="/assets/uploads/unique-filename.ext" />`

### Files Modified
- ✅ `backend/routes/storage.js` - Full file upload implementation
- ✅ `backend/package.json` - Added multer dependency
- ✅ `src/api/integrations.js` - Custom UploadFile function
- ✅ `public/assets/uploads/.gitkeep` - Created upload directory

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Restart Backend (if needed)
The backend should auto-reload with `--watch`, but if not:
```powershell
# Find and kill the process
netstat -ano | findstr :3001  # Find PID
taskkill /F /PID <PID>

# Restart
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Upload
1. Go to Settings → Tenant Management
2. Click "Create New Tenant" or edit existing tenant
3. Click "Choose File" under Company Logo
4. Select an image (PNG, JPG, etc.)
5. Should see "Logo uploaded successfully!" toast
6. Should see image preview
7. Save tenant
8. Refresh page - logo should persist

### 3. Verify Stored File
Check `public/assets/uploads/` directory:
```powershell
dir public\assets\uploads
```

## Alternative: Use External URLs

If you prefer to host logos elsewhere, you can also:
1. Skip file upload
2. Paste direct URL in "Logo URL" field: `https://example.com/logo.png`
3. Or use local asset: `/assets/your-logo.png` (place in `public/assets/`)

## Future Enhancements

For production, consider:
- **Cloud storage** (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Azure Blob)
- **Image optimization** (resize, compress, convert to WebP)
- **CDN integration** for faster delivery
- **File cleanup** (delete old logos when replaced)
- **Better validation** (dimensions, file type verification)

## Files to Commit

```bash
git add backend/routes/storage.js
git add backend/package.json
git add backend/package-lock.json
git add src/api/integrations.js
git add public/assets/uploads/.gitkeep
git commit -m "Implement local file upload for tenant logos

- Add multer for multipart file uploads
- Store files in public/assets/uploads/
- Replace Base44 SDK UploadFile with custom implementation
- Support jpeg, png, gif, webp, svg (max 5MB)
- Auto-generate unique filenames
- Return URLs as /assets/uploads/filename
"
```

**The upload should now work!** Try uploading a logo and let me know if you see any errors.
