  - name: Refactor Codebase for Standards and Security
    description: >
      Analyze and refactor the entire codebase to improve structure, naming consistency,
      modularity, and security. Ensure code follows best practices and is well-documented.
    goals:
      - Enforce consistent naming conventions across files, functions, and variables
      - Modularize large files and split long functions into reusable components
      - Remove dead, duplicate, or unreachable code
      - Apply security best practices (e.g., input validation, safe API usage)
      - Add missing documentation and comments for public functions and modules
