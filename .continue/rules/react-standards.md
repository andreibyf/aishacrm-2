# React Standards

When generating or editing React code:
- Use React 18 function components with hooks.
- Prefer server-safe patterns compatible with Vite.
- Use Tailwind utility classes instead of custom CSS.
- Keep components pure and colocate logic with components.
- Use TypeScript types for props and state.
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing expensive values.
- Follow folder structure: src/components, src/hooks, src/lib, src/pages.
- Use absolute imports from src/ for better readability.
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Ensure accessibility by using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes.
