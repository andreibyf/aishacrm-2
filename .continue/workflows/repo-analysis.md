# Repo Analysis Workflow (Qwen2.5-Coder-32B)

Perform a full repo analysis with the following goals:
1. Identify architecture patterns and folder structure.
2. Map frontend -> backend -> database flows.
3. Identify potential bugs, anti-patterns, or missing error handling.
4. Identify missing unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests.
5. Identify Supabase RLS risks or missing policies.
6. Identify Redis caching opportunities or inconsistencies.
7. Identify unused files, dead code, or outdated dependencies.
8. Suggest a prioritized list of improvements.
This is your "senior engineer audit."
