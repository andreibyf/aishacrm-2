## Chapter 1: Introduction

Aisha CRM is a multi-tenant, AI-powered customer relationship management platform. It brings together contact, account, lead, and opportunity management with AI assistants, AI telephony, and automation. Aisha is designed to be performant, secure, and resilient — even if external services are down, an independent backend ensures your work can continue.

### What Makes Aisha CRM Different

- AI Executive Assistant with deep CRM context
- AI telephony: transcribed calls, AI notes, auto follow-ups
- AI campaigns: at-scale outreach with personalized content
- Independent backend with automatic failover for zero downtime
- Supabase-backed data with row-level security (RLS)
- Clear tenant isolation — UUID-first design for data safety

### System Requirements (End Users)

- Modern browser: Chrome, Edge, or Firefox (latest two versions)
- Recommended screen width ≥ 1280px for best layout
- Reliable internet connection (>5 Mbps)

> Note: Mobile devices are supported for basic workflows. For admin tasks and data-intensive views, a desktop browser is recommended.

### Roles and Access

- Employee: Access to own/assigned records
- Manager: Tenant-wide visibility and reporting
- Admin: Tenant configuration and user management
- Superadmin: System-level configuration (Aisha platform)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 2: Getting Started

### First Login and Profile Setup

1. Open the app: `http://localhost:4000` (Docker dev)
2. Sign in with your email; if invited, complete signup via the link
3. Go to Profile Settings → Update your name, phone, department, and avatar
4. Preferences → Set timezone, date/time format, and week start day

> Tip: A correct timezone ensures activities and reminders align with your calendar.

### Navigation Basics

- Left navigation menu provides access to modules: Dashboard, Contacts, Accounts, Leads, Opportunities, Activities, Reports, AI, etc.
- The header hosts global search, quick actions, and your profile menu.
- Many lists support column configuration, sorting, filtering, and pagination.

### Using Global Search

Use the search bar to find contacts, accounts, leads, or opportunities by name, email, phone, or tags. Advanced filters are available per module.

### Quick Start Tasks

- Create your first contact (Chapter 4)
- Import a CSV of leads (Chapter 6)
- Explore the dashboard widgets (Chapter 3)
- Try the AI Assistant to query your tenant’s data (Chapter 3)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 3: Core Features Overview

### Dashboard

The dashboard surfaces high-value information:

- Metrics: contacts, leads, opportunities, pipeline value
- Charts: lead sources, pipeline by stage, activity trends
- Widgets: recent activities, upcoming tasks, alerts

> Best Practice: Review your dashboard each morning and at day’s end.

### AI Executive Assistant

- Ask natural-language questions: “Show high-value opportunities closing this month.”
- Create records: “Add a call with John for tomorrow at 10am.”
- Update data: “Change opportunity ‘Acme Renewal’ to Negotiation.”
- Analyze: “Summarize my team’s activity this week.”

Privacy and safety: The assistant enforces role-based access and tenant isolation.

### Calendar Integration (In-App)

- View activities by month, week, day, or agenda.
- Drag-and-drop to reschedule; set reminders and priorities.
- External sync (Google/Outlook) is planned; use in-app calendar for now.

### Search and Filters

- Module lists feature saved filters, tag filters, owner filters, and date range filters.
- Combine filters to narrow large datasets quickly.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 4: Contact Management

Contacts are individuals you interact with. They can be linked to an Account and to activities, opportunities, and notes.

### Creating Contacts

1. Contacts → “+ Add Contact”
2. Enter First Name and Last Name (required)
3. Add email, phone, job title, department
4. Link to an existing Account or create a new one
5. Assign an owner and add tags
6. Save

### Importing Contacts (CSV)

1. Contacts → Import
2. Upload CSV (UTF-8, headers on row 1)
3. Map columns to fields (email, phone, etc.)
4. Validate preview; resolve duplicates
5. Start import and monitor progress

> Tip: Standardize phone and email formats before import to improve match quality.

### Working with Contacts

- Timeline: see activities, notes, and interactions
- Quick actions: call, email, schedule, log activity
- Tags: segment for campaigns or follow-ups

### Bulk Operations

- Select multiple contacts → Bulk actions: tag, assign, export, delete
- Safeguards prevent accidental bulk deletions

### Best Practices

- Link every contact to an account where possible
- Capture notes after each interaction
- Use meaningful tags (e.g., VIP, Prospect, Partner)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 5: Account Management

Accounts represent companies or organizations.

### Creating Accounts

1. Accounts → “+ Add Account”
2. Provide company name (required), website, phone, industry
3. Add address and revenue/employee size if known
4. Assign an owner and tags

### Relationships and Hierarchies

- Link multiple contacts to an account
- Associate opportunities and activities
- Use tags and types (Prospect, Customer, Partner, Competitor)

### Best Practices

- One account per company; avoid duplicates
- Keep account health up to date with notes and activities

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 6: Lead Management

Leads are pre-qualified prospects. Convert leads once they are sales-ready.

### Creating Leads

1. Leads → “+ Add Lead”
2. Capture first/last name, company, email/phone, source
3. Set priority and status (New, Contacted, Qualified, etc.)

### Lead Scoring

Aisha scores leads 0–100 based on profile completeness, engagement, company fit, and source quality. Use the score to triage outreach.

### Converting Leads

When a lead is qualified:

- Convert to Contact
- Create or link Account
- Create Opportunity with stage and value

All history (notes, activities) is preserved.

### Best Practices

- Qualify quickly and consistently
- Keep source data clean for ROI reporting

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 7: Opportunity Management

Opportunities represent potential deals.

### Stages and Pipeline

- Prospecting → Qualification → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won/Lost
- Configure probability per stage for weighted forecasts

### Creating Opportunities

1. Opportunities → “+ Add Opportunity”
2. Provide name, amount, expected close date (required)
3. Link Account and primary Contact
4. Choose stage and probability
5. Add next steps

### Kanban and List Views

- Use Kanban to drag-and-drop across stages
- List view supports sorting and filtering by owner, stage, amount, date

### Best Practices

- Keep stages current; stale stages distort forecasts
- Document next steps and set an owner for every deal

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 8: Activities and Tasks

Activities help you drive work forward: calls, emails, meetings, tasks, notes, demos, proposals, and AI-driven activities.

### Creating Activities

1. “+ Add Activity”
2. Select type (Call, Email, Meeting, Task, etc.)
3. Provide subject, description, due date/time, priority
4. Link to Contact/Account/Lead/Opportunity

### Managing Activities

### Best Practices

- Log every meaningful interaction
- Use reminders for time-sensitive tasks

- AI-generated summaries and action items
- Outcome tracking (Connected, Voicemail, No Answer, etc.)
- Link calls to contacts, leads, opportunities, and accounts

### Typical Workflow

1. Place or receive a call via your provider or softphone
2. Aisha logs the call and processes audio (if available)
3. Review the AI summary; adjust as needed
4. Create follow-up tasks automatically

### Best Practices

- Confirm sensitive details in summaries before sharing
- Use consistent naming for call outcomes to keep analytics clean

2. Choose type (Calls, Emails)
3. Define target audience (tags, filters, lists)
4. Write or customize AI prompt/templates
5. Set schedule, throttling, and retries
6. Launch and monitor progress

### Tracking & Metrics

- Per-contact activity history

### Compliance and Safety

### Best Practices

- Review weekly with your team
- Align definitions (e.g., what qualifies as a lead?)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 12: Workflows & Automation

Automate repetitive steps to ensure consistency and speed.

### Concepts

- Triggers: events that start workflows (record created/updated, status change)
- Actions: what a workflow does (create task, send email via integration, update field)
- Conditions: gates that must pass

### Example: Lead → Qualified

When a lead becomes Qualified:

1. Create a follow-up task for owner in 2 days
2. Create an Opportunity with default stage
3. Notify manager via email/webhook

### Best Practices

- Start simple; monitor outcomes; iterate
- Keep a runbook documenting each workflow

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 13: Advanced Features

### Document Processing

- AI extracts contact details; review and save as Contact

### Duplicate Detection & Merge

- Find duplicates in Contacts, Accounts, Leads
- Merge records safely; activities and relationships are preserved

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 14: Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- Can’t log in: Confirm invite accepted and user is active
- Missing data: Check filters or ownership/role restrictions
- API errors: Retry; if persistent, contact support with timestamp and action
