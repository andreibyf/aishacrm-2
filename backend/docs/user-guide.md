<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 3: The Dashboard: Your Command Center

The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging in. It provides a high-level overview of your most important metrics and upcoming activities.

### Understanding Dashboard Widgets
Your dashboard is composed of several "widgets," each serving a specific purpose.

-   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: At-a-glance numbers for your total contacts, open opportunities, conversion rates, and pipeline value.
-   **Upcoming Tasks**: A list of your tasks and activities that are due today or are overdue. This is your daily to-do list.
-   **Pipeline by Stage**: A bar or funnel chart showing the value and volume of opportunities in each stage of your sales pipeline.
-   **Recent Activity Feed**: A real-time stream of activities logged by you and your team.
-   **Lead Source Performance**: A chart showing which sources are generating the most valuable leads.

### Customizing Your Dashboard
Make the dashboard work for you.
1.  Click the **"Customize Dashboard"** or gear icon.
2.  **Rearrange Widgets**: Drag and drop widgets to place the most important information at the top.
3.  **Add/Remove Widgets**: Select which widgets you want to see on your dashboard.
4.  **Filter Data**: Many widgets allow you to filter the data, for example, by a specific time period (e.g., "This Quarter") or by team members.

### A Recommended Daily Workflow
1.  **Morning Review (5 minutes)**: Start your day by reviewing the **Upcoming Tasks** widget. Identify your top priorities and check the **Recent Activity Feed** for any important updates from your team.
2.  **Throughout the Day**: As you complete calls, send emails, and attend meetings, log them as activities in Aisha CRM.
3.  **End-of-Day Wrap-up (10 minutes)**: Review your dashboard again. Mark completed tasks, update opportunity stages, and schedule follow-up activities for the next day.

# Part 2: Core CRM Modules

## Chapter 4: Mastering Contact Management

Contacts are the heart of your CRM. This chapter covers how to manage them effectively.

### Creating a New Contact
1.  Click the **Quick Create (+)** button and select "New Contact," or navigate to the **Contacts** module and click **"+ Add Contact"**.
2.  Fill in the essential details:
    -   **First Name & Last Name** (Required)
    -   **Email** & **Phone Number**
    -   **Account Name**: Link the contact to their company. If the account doesn't exist, you can often create it directly from this screen.
    -   **Job Title**: Helps you understand their role.
3.  Add **Tags** to categorize the contact (e.g., "Decision Maker," "Influencer," "VIP").
4.  Click **Save**.

### Importing Contacts in Bulk
Use the CSV import for adding a large number of contacts at once.
1.  Navigate to **Contacts → Import**.
2.  **Download the CSV Template**. This ensures your columns match Aisha's fields.
3.  **Prepare Your File**:
    -   Do not change the column headers in the template.
    -   Ensure data is clean (e.g., consistent phone number formats).
    -   Save the file as a CSV.
4.  **Upload the File** and map your columns to the corresponding fields in Aisha CRM.
5.  **Preview and Validate**: The system will show a preview and flag potential errors or duplicates.
6.  **Start Import**. You can monitor the progress and will be notified upon completion.

### The Contact Detail Page
This page gives you a 360-degree view of a contact.
-   **Details Panel**: Shows all the field information for the contact including name, phone, email, company, job title, status, and more. Fields without values show "Not set" placeholders.
-   **Description Section**: Static context about the record — "What is this about?" Use this for background information, requirements, or notes that don't change frequently.
-   **Notes & Activity Section**: A running log of updates — "What happened?" Add timestamped notes for calls, meetings, follow-ups, and status changes.
-   **Timeline/Activity Feed**: A chronological history of every interaction, including calls, emails, notes, and meetings.
-   **Related Lists**: Tabs or sections showing related records, such as their Account, Opportunities they are involved in, and support cases.

> **Tip:** Click the eye icon (View) to see all available information without entering Edit mode. All fields are displayed with smart formatting (currency, dates, clickable URLs, status badges).

### Finding and Filtering Contacts
-   **Global Search**: Use the search bar at the top for a quick lookup.
-   **List View Filters**: In the Contacts module, use the filter panel to create specific lists. For example:
    -   "All contacts in California with the tag 'VIP'"
    -   "All contacts I haven't spoken to in the last 90 days"
-   **Saved Views**: If you frequently use a set of filters, save it as a custom view for one-click access in the future.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 5: Effective Account Management

Accounts represent the companies or organizations you do business with. Proper account management provides a complete picture of your relationship with a client.

### Accounts vs. Contacts
-   An **Account** is the company (e.g., "Acme Corporation").
-   A **Contact** is a person who works at that company (e.g., "John Smith," an employee at Acme Corporation).
-   A single Account can have multiple Contacts linked to it.

### Creating an Account
1.  Navigate to the **Accounts** module and click **"+ Add Account"**.
2.  Enter the **Account Name** (Required).
3.  Fill in other key information:
    -   **Website**
    -   **Industry**
    -   **Main Phone Number**
    -   **Billing & Shipping Addresses**
4.  Assign an **Account Owner** (the person primarily responsible for the relationship).
5.  Use **Tags** or a **Type** field to categorize the account (e.g., "Customer," "Prospect," "Partner").
6.  Click **Save**.

### The Account Hierarchy
For large enterprises, you can create parent-child relationships between accounts.
-   **Parent Account**: The main headquarters (e.g., "Global Tech Inc.").
-   **Child Accounts**: Regional offices or subsidiaries (e.g., "Global Tech - North America").
This allows you to see a rolled-up view of all activities and opportunities across the entire organization.

### Best Practices for Account Management
-   **Avoid Duplicates**: Before creating a new account, use the search function to ensure it doesn't already exist.
-   **Keep Data Current**: Regularly update account information, such as addresses or changes in company size.
-   **Log All Interactions**: Even if you speak with one contact, log the activity at the Account level if it pertains to the company as a whole.
-   **Define Account Health**: Use a custom field or notes to track if an account is "Healthy," "At Risk," or "Needs Attention."

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 6: Lead Management Workflow

Leads are the starting point of your sales process. They are individuals or companies who have expressed interest but have not yet been qualified as a viable opportunity.

### The Lead Lifecycle
1.  **Capture**: A new lead is created in the system.
2.  **Qualify**: You research the lead and make initial contact to determine if they are a good fit.
3.  **Convert**: If qualified, the lead is converted into a Contact, Account, and (optionally) an Opportunity.
4.  **Nurture**: If not ready, the lead is nurtured with marketing campaigns until they are sales-ready.

### Creating and Importing Leads
The process is similar to creating contacts. You can create leads one by one or import them in bulk via a CSV file.
-   **Crucial Field**: Always capture the **Lead Source** (e.g., "Website," "Trade Show," "Referral"). This is vital for reporting on marketing ROI.

### Lead Scoring
Aisha CRM can automatically score leads based on predefined criteria to help you prioritize. Scores are typically based on:
-   **Demographics**: Job title, industry, company size.
-   **Engagement**: Website visits, email opens, content downloads.
A higher score indicates a "hotter" lead that you should contact first.

### The Conversion Process
This is a key step. When you convert a lead:
1.  Click the **"Convert"** button on the lead record.
2.  Aisha CRM will automatically create:
    -   A **Contact** record.
    -   An **Account** record (if it doesn't already exist).
3.  You will be prompted to (optionally) create an **Opportunity** record. This is where you will track the potential deal.
4.  **All activities and notes from the lead record are automatically transferred** to the new Contact, Account, and Opportunity records, ensuring no history is lost.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 7: Opportunity Pipeline Management

Opportunities (or "Deals") are the core of your sales pipeline. Managing them effectively is crucial for forecasting and hitting your revenue targets.

### Understanding Pipeline Stages
Your pipeline is a series of stages that an opportunity moves through from creation to close. A typical set of stages might be:
1.  **Prospecting**: Initial discovery and research.
2.  **Qualification**: Confirmed that the prospect has a need, budget, and authority to buy.
3.  **Proposal/Quote**: You have sent a formal proposal.
4.  **Negotiation**: You are discussing terms and pricing.
5.  **Closed Won**: The deal is signed!
6.  **Closed Lost**: The deal did not go through.

### Creating an Opportunity
1.  Navigate to **Opportunities** and click **"+ Add Opportunity"**.
2.  Fill in the key details:
    -   **Opportunity Name**: Be descriptive (e.g., "Q4 Website Redesign - Acme Corp").
    -   **Account & Primary Contact**: Link the deal to the relevant company and person.
    -   **Amount**: The estimated value of the deal.
    -   **Expected Close Date**: When you anticipate the deal will close. This is critical for forecasting.
    -   **Stage**: The current stage of the opportunity.
3.  **Document Next Steps**: Always define the next action required to move the deal forward.
4.  Click **Save**.

### Managing Your Pipeline: List View vs. Kanban View
Aisha CRM offers two ways to view your opportunities:
-   **List View**: A traditional spreadsheet-like view. It's useful for sorting and filtering a large number of deals (e.g., "Show me all deals over $10,000 closing this quarter").
-   **Kanban View**: A visual, card-based view where each column represents a stage. You can **drag and drop** opportunities from one stage to the next. This is great for daily pipeline management and team meetings.

### Forecasting
Your sales forecast is typically calculated as:
`Forecast = Sum of (Amount × Probability %)` for all open opportunities.
-   Each stage in your pipeline is associated with a probability of closing (e.g., Qualification = 25%, Negotiation = 75%).
-   **To ensure an accurate forecast, you must keep your opportunity stages and amounts up to date.**

### Best Practices for Pipeline Hygiene
-   **Update Weekly**: Review every open opportunity in your pipeline at least once a week.
-   **Stale Deals**: If a deal has had no activity for a long time, either re-engage the prospect or move it to Closed Lost.
-   **Document Everything**: Use notes and activities to document why a deal is won, lost, or stalled.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 8: Tracking Your Work with Activities

Activities are the building blocks of your daily workflow. They help you track every interaction with customers and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

### What is an Activity?

An activity represents any action or task related to your work:
-   **Tasks**: To-dos that need to be completed
-   **Calls**: Phone conversations with contacts or leads
-   **Meetings**: Scheduled appointments or demos
-   **Emails**: Important email communications to log
-   **Follow-ups**: Scheduled touchpoints with prospects

### Creating an Activity

1.  Navigate to **Activities** and click **"+ Add Activity"**
2.  Select the **Type** (Task, Call, Meeting, Email, etc.)
3.  Fill in the required fields:
    -   **Subject**: Brief description of the activity
    -   **Due Date & Time**: When this should happen
    -   **Priority**: Normal, High, or Low
4.  **Link to a Record**: Associate the activity with a Contact, Account, Lead, or Opportunity
5.  Add **Description** for context — "What is this about?"
6.  Click **Save**

### The Activity Detail View

Click the eye icon on any activity to see the full detail panel. The view shows all available fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Subject** | Title of the activity |
| **Status** | Scheduled, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled |
| **Type** | Task, Call, Meeting, Email, etc. |
| **Due Date & Time** | When the activity should occur (with timezone) |
| **Assigned To** | Who is responsible for this activity |
| **Related To** | Linked Contact, Account, Lead, or Opportunity |
| **Priority** | Normal, High, or Low |
| **Location** | Where the activity takes place (for meetings) |
| **Duration** | How long the activity lasted |
| **Description** | Context — "What is this about?" |
| **Outcome** | Result after completion — "What happened?" |

### Understanding Description vs. Notes

These two fields serve different purposes:

| | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Static context set when creating/editing | Running log of updates over time |
| **When Set** | At creation or during edit | Added incrementally throughout the lifecycle |
| **Content** | Background info, requirements, scope | "Called - left voicemail", "Sent proposal" |

> **Example:**  
> **Description:** "Follow up on Q4 renewal. Client mentioned budget concerns."  
> **Notes:**  
> - Dec 9, 2:30pm — "Left voicemail, will try again tomorrow"  
> - Dec 10, 10:00am — "Connected - reviewing with CFO"

### Cross-Linked Notes

When you add a note to an Activity that has a related record:
1.  The note is saved on the Activity
2.  **A copy is automatically created on the related Contact/Account/Lead/Opportunity**
3.  Both records stay in sync without manual duplication

This means when you view the Contact, you'll see all notes from related Activities.

### Managing Your Activities

-   **List View**: See all activities with filters for status, date range, and assigned user
-   **Calendar View**: Visualize activities on a calendar
-   **Overdue Alerts**: Activities past their due date are highlighted
-   **Bulk Actions**: Complete or reschedule multiple activities at once

### Best Practices

-   **Log Everything**: Document every customer interaction immediately
-   **Use Outcomes**: After completing an activity, record what happened
-   **Set Follow-ups**: Never end an activity without scheduling the next action
-   **Keep It Current**: Update status as activities progress

-   **Use Full Names**: Refer to "John Smith" instead of "John."
-   **Speak Naturally**: You don't need to use rigid commands. "Tell me about my top deals" works just as well as "List opportunities sorted by amount descending."
-   **Trust but Verify**: For critical actions like updating data, the AI will ask for confirmation. Always review the change before accepting.
-   **Use Time References**: Say "tomorrow", "next Monday", or "at 3pm" for scheduling activities.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Chapter 10: Scaling Outreach with AI Campaigns

AI Campaigns allow you to automate and personalize your outreach to a large audience, whether through email or phone calls.

### What Are AI Campaigns?
Instead of manually contacting hundreds of leads, you can define a target audience and a message template. The AI then generates a personalized version of the message for each recipient and executes the outreach automatically.

### Campaign Types
-   **AI Email Campaigns**: Send a sequence of personalized emails.
-   **AI Call Campaigns**: Initiate automated phone calls where an AI agent delivers a message or engages in a simple conversation.

### Creating Your First Campaign
1.  Navigate to **AI Campaigns → Create New Campaign**.
2.  **Name Your Campaign** and choose the type (Email or Call).
3.  **Define Your Audience**: This is the most important step.
    -   **Use Tags**: Target a list of contacts with a specific tag (e.g., "2025 Trade Show Leads").
    -   **Use Filters**: Create a dynamic list based on record properties (e.g., "All leads in the 'Manufacturing' industry that are 'Unqualified'").
    -   **Upload a CSV**: Use a one-time list for a specific campaign.
4.  **Compose Your Message/Prompt**:
    -   For emails, write a template using **merge fields** for personalization (e.g., `{{contact.first_name}}`).
    -   For calls, write the core script or prompt for the AI to use.
5.  **Set the Schedule**:
    -   Define the start and end dates.
    -   Set the **throttling** (e.g., "no more than 100 emails per day") to control the volume.
    -   Configure retry logic for failed attempts.
6.  **Review and Launch**.

### Monitoring Campaign Performance
The campaign dashboard provides key metrics:
-   **Sent/Attempted**: The total number of messages sent or calls initiated.
-   **Delivered/Connected**: Successful deliveries or connections.
-   **Opened/Replied** (for emails): Engagement metrics.
-   **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of the audience that completed the desired action (e.g., clicked a link, scheduled a meeting).

### Compliance and Best Practices
-   **Honor Opt-Outs**: Ensure your campaigns automatically exclude anyone who has unsubscribed.
-   **Follow Regulations**: Be aware of and comply with regulations like CAN-SPAM (for email) and TCPA (for calls).
-   **Start Small**: Run a small test campaign first to check for errors and gauge performance before launching to a large audience.
-   **Be Authentic**: Even though it's automated, your messaging should be genuine and provide value.

<div class="page-break"></div>

# Part 4: Analysis and Best Practices

## Chapter 11: Reporting and Analytics

Data is only useful if you can understand it. Aisha CRM's reporting tools help you visualize your performance and identify trends.

### Standard Reports
Aisha CRM comes with several out-of-the-box reports.

-   **Sales Pipeline Report**: Your main sales dashboard. Shows opportunities by stage, weighted forecast, and win/loss rates.
-   **Lead Source Analysis**: See which marketing channels are generating the most leads and which ones are converting at the highest rate.
-   **Activity Report**: Track your team's productivity. See the volume of calls, emails, and meetings logged over time. Filter by team member to see individual performance.
-   **Sales Velocity Report**: Measures how long it takes for an opportunity to move from creation to close. A decreasing velocity means your team is closing deals faster.

### Exporting Your Data
You can export data from any report or list view.
-   **PDF Export**: Creates a clean, presentation-ready document with charts and graphs. Ideal for sharing with management.
-   **CSV Export**: Exports the raw data into a spreadsheet format. Use this if you want to perform your own analysis in Excel, Google Sheets, or another BI tool.

### Creating Saved Views for Custom Reports
While you may not be able to build reports from scratch, you can create powerful, reusable report views.
1.  Go to a module list, like **Opportunities**.
2.  **Apply Filters**: Add the criteria for your report (e.g., `Stage = "Negotiation"` AND `Amount > 10000`).
3.  **Select Columns**: Choose which data columns you want to see in your view.
4.  **Sort the Data**: Sort by close date, amount, or any other field.
5.  **Save the View**: Click the "Save View" button and give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Large Deals in Negotiation").
This view will now be available in a dropdown menu for you to access anytime.

## Chapter 12: Tips, Tricks, and Best Practices

Becoming a power user of Aisha CRM involves building good habits and learning a few tricks.

### Daily Habits for Success
-   **The 5-Minute Morning Review**: Start your day by checking your dashboard for priorities.
-   **Log It or It Didn't Happen**: Log every meaningful customer interaction immediately. Don't wait until the end of the day.
-   **The 10-Minute End-of-Day Wrap-up**: Update your opportunities, complete your tasks, and plan your follow-ups for tomorrow.

### Data Quality is Everyone's Responsibility
A CRM is only as good as the data in it.
-   **No Duplicates**: Always search before you create a new record.
-   **Be Consistent**: Use tags and custom fields consistently across your team.
-   **Add Context**: Use the notes field to add "why" behind the data. Why did the customer buy? Why was the deal lost?

### Time Management Tips
-   **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Learn the shortcuts for common actions like creating new records or saving forms.
-   **Batch Your Tasks**: Block out time on your calendar to do similar tasks together (e.g., make all your follow-up calls from 10 AM to 11 AM).
-   **Let the AI Help**: Use the AI Assistant for quick data entry and updates to avoid clicking through multiple screens.

### Security Best Practices
-   **Use a Strong Password** and do not share it.
-   **Log Out** on shared computers.
-   **Be Mindful of Permissions** when sharing records or reports.

A: Click the "Forgot Password?" link on the login screen. If you are already logged in, you can change it in your Profile Settings.

**Q: Can I merge duplicate contacts?**

A: You can reassign ownership of the record to them, or if you just want to bring it to their attention, use an @mention in a note (e.g., "@John Smith, can you take a look at this?").

**Q: Why can't I see a specific record?**  
A: It's likely a permissions issue. The record may be owned by someone else and not shared with you. Contact the record owner or your administrator.

**Q: Can I use Aisha CRM on my mobile phone?**
