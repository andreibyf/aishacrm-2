# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
- This is a Vite + React application generated by Base44.
- The app communicates with the Base44 API for backend operations.
- Source code is organized under `src/` with clear separation by domain (e.g., `accounts`, `activities`, `ai`, etc.).

## Architecture & Data Flow
- Major features are grouped in `src/components/` by business domain (e.g., `accounts`, `activities`, `ai`).
- API communication is handled in `src/api/` (see `base44Client.js`, `entities.js`, etc.).
- Pages are in `src/pages/`, each representing a route/view.
- Shared utilities and hooks are in `src/utils/` and `src/hooks/`.
- Styling uses Tailwind CSS (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`).

## Developer Workflows
- **Setup:** Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID`
- **Dev Server:** Use `npm run dev` to start local development
- **Build:** Use `npm run build` (see `vite.config.js`)
- **Linting:** Run `npm run lint` (see `eslint.config.js`)
- **Security Audit:** Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- **Testing:** Check `src/pages/UnitTests.jsx` for custom/unit test patterns

## Project-Specific Conventions
- Components are function-based React, often grouped by domain
- API calls use Base44 SDK via entities in `src/api/entities.js`
- Local functions in `src/functions/` serve as fallbacks when Base44 is unavailable
- Use `src/api/fallbackFunctions.js` for resilient Base44 → local auto-failover
- Use `ConfirmDialog` component instead of `window.confirm()` for better UX
- Wrap debug logs with `import.meta.env.DEV` to exclude from production
- Error boundaries are implemented at root level; add component-level as needed
- Dialogs and widgets (e.g., AI assistants) are in `src/components/ai/`
- Bulk actions and detail panels are common UI patterns
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Performance cache available via `performanceCache` from `src/components/shared/PerformanceCache.jsx`

## Integration Points
- External API: All backend data flows through Base44 API clients in `src/api/`.
- AI features: Custom widgets and assistants in `src/components/ai/`.
- Contact Base44 support at app@base44.com for integration issues.

## Examples
- To add a new business domain, create a folder in `src/components/` and a corresponding page in `src/pages/`.
- For new API endpoints, extend the relevant client in `src/api/` and update consumers in components/pages.
- For new UI widgets, follow patterns in `src/components/ui/` and `src/components/ai/`.

## Key Files & Directories
- `src/api/` — API clients and integrations with Base44
- `src/functions/` — Local functions that can run as fallbacks when Base44 is down
- `src/api/fallbackFunctions.js` — Auto-failover wrapper (Base44 → local)
- `src/components/` — Domain-specific and shared React components
- `src/pages/` — Route/view components
- `src/utils/`, `src/hooks/` — Shared logic
- `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `eslint.config.js` — Build, style, and lint config
