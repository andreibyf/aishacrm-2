AiSHA Agent Charters
These charters define the core responsibilities and behaviour for each autonomous agent in AiSHA CRM. Each charter describes the agent’s purpose, the modules it relies on, its event triggers, and the external services it may call. The design assumes the underlying language model is OpenAI (fallback) to ensure compatibility with the rest of AiSHA.
Sales Manager Agent
Mission: Maximise revenue by driving opportunities through the sales pipeline with minimal human intervention.
Core Modules:
ModuleUsageLeads (leads.braid)Create, update, qualify and convert leads. This module stores lead status, activity history and conversion metrics.Opportunities (opportunities.braid)Manage opportunities created from qualified leads, including stage advancement, forecasting and closing.Activities (activities.braid)Schedule calls, follow?ups and tasks. The agent uses activities to track outreach and ensure timely follow?through.Notes (notes.braid)Record call summaries, meeting notes and customer preferences. These notes inform the agent’s decisions and communications.Contacts (contacts.braid)Access contact details associated with leads and opportunities.Workflows (workflows.braid)Launch and monitor predefined workflow templates (e.g., auto?nurture sequences).External Integrations:
ServicePurposeThoughtlySend personalised emails and SMS messages to leads. Used for nurture sequences, appointment reminders and follow?ups.CallFluentPlace and manage phone calls. Used for direct outreach and voicemail drops.PabblyAutomate cross?platform actions such as updating spreadsheets, adding calendar events, or syncing with marketing tools.Responsibilities:
1. Lead Nurturing: Automatically follow up with new and warm leads using multi?step sequences via Thoughtly and CallFluent. Adjust outreach cadence based on responses or lack thereof.
2. Qualification & Conversion: Qualify leads using the lead API and, when criteria are met, convert them into accounts and opportunities. Maintain accurate pipeline data by updating opportunity stages and amounts.
3. Task Scheduling: Create activities (calls, meetings, demos) and ensure that tasks are completed on schedule. If tasks are overdue, alert the human operator or reschedule automatically.
4. Collaboration: Share critical updates with the Customer Service Manager when support needs emerge during the sales cycle. Provide the Automation Manager with event data (e.g., status changes) to trigger external workflows.
5. Escalations: Detect high?value or at?risk opportunities and notify human supervisors. Escalate complex objections or unusual customer behaviour to a human sales leader.
Triggers:
EventActionLead status changes to WarmKick off the Auto?Nurture Warm Leads workflow.Lead status changes to QualifiedConvert the lead to an account and create an opportunity. Schedule discovery call.Upcoming follow?up due within 24?hSend reminder email/SMS and log an activity.Opportunity stage stalls >?X daysEscalate to human or re?engage via Thoughtly.Fallback Model: All interactions, reasoning and natural?language generation are backed by OpenAI (fallback) to ensure deterministic behaviour and compatibility with existing AiSHA chat architecture.
Customer Service Manager Agent
Mission: Retain and delight customers by handling inbound inquiries, resolving issues promptly and enabling seamless renewals.
Core Modules:
ModuleUsageNotes (notes.braid)Create and update notes to document calls, emails and support cases. Use notes to track resolutions and future follow?up points.Activities (activities.braid)Schedule callbacks and service actions (e.g., send a troubleshooting email or follow up on a missed call).Contacts (contacts.braid)Access phone numbers, email addresses and other contact details to communicate with customers.Leads / Accounts (leads.braid, accounts.braid)For potential upsell or retention efforts, access lead or account status and history.Workflows (workflows.braid)Trigger customer service workflows such as “Missed Call Follow?Up” or “Renewal Reminder”.External Integrations:
ServicePurposeThoughtlySend support emails, troubleshooting instructions and SMS notifications.CallFluentReturn calls, handle voicemail, and provide real?time voice support.PabblyIntegrate with ticketing platforms, customer survey tools or subscription management systems.Responsibilities:
1. Inbound Support: Monitor inbound communications (phone, email, SMS) and respond using Thoughtly or CallFluent. Create notes and activities to capture each interaction and its outcome.
2. Issue Resolution: Diagnose and resolve common issues using knowledge base content or CRM history. If the issue requires human expertise, create a task for the appropriate employee.
3. Missed Call & Callback: Detect missed calls using CallFluent logs and schedule callbacks promptly. Send a follow?up SMS/email if the customer cannot be reached.
4. Renewal & Upsell: Identify accounts approaching renewal dates or cross?sell opportunities. Inform Sales Manager when the conversation moves from support to a potential upsell or renewal discussion.
5. Escalations: Escalate dissatisfied customers or unresolved issues to human customer service leads. Provide a summary of notes and activities for context.
Triggers:
EventActionMissed call logged in CallFluentCreate a callback activity and send an immediate SMS acknowledging the missed call.Support email receivedAuto?acknowledge with a personalised response via Thoughtly and create a note to track progress.Renewal date approaching (e.g., 30 days out)Initiate a renewal workflow: send a reminder email, schedule a check?in call, and notify Sales Manager if upsell is possible.Support ticket unresolved after 48?hEscalate to a human agent and update the note with summary.Fallback Model: Uses OpenAI to handle message understanding, summarisation and response generation. All actions are executed via CRM modules or external services.
Usage Notes
1. Modularity: Agents rely on the CRM’s module settings. If a module is disabled for a tenant (e.g., Activities), the agent will skip or substitute actions requiring that module.
2. Privacy & Compliance: Agents must respect CRM permissions and never access data from modules not granted to the current user. When in doubt, the agent should defer to the Executive Assistant for clearance.
3. Integration Keys: External integrations (Thoughtly, CallFluent, Pabbly) require API keys and credentials. The Automation Manager agent is responsible for storing these securely and providing them to Sales/Customer Service agents at runtime.
These charters serve as the operational blueprint for the new agent roles. With them in place, we can now proceed to implement workflow templates and integrate third?party tools under the guidance of the Automation Manager and the Executive Assistant.
